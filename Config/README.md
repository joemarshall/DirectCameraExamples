# Examples for DirectCamera plugin

To build the examples you need the Direct Camera Android plugin installed to Unreal Engine.

Build using the make_releases.py script.

```
python .\make_releases.py build android
```

This assumes you have unreal under `c:\\epic`. If it is somewhere else, you need to add the `-ue-path <path>` argument to the script.

You can also build a Quest passthrough camera example by calling 
```
python .\make_releases.py build quest
```
